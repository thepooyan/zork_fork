idea:
    remove junk from sentences before proccess

to make:
- shout action
- key and lock objects
- burn the letter
- flip the table
- idol says diffrent random things!
- drop or pick multiple things
- complete inventory
- test existing actions: (open, pick)
- action on inventory
- health bar
- health query
- directions query
- npc creation ?!?!
- npc interactions
- involantary actions (like death, time bomb, npc talking to you)
- accidents (an action happening when you enter a view), (once or every time)
- hello action! (for fun :) )
- save/load action!
- change terminal colors
- action to show discovered actions so far!

for later:
- handle multiple word actions
- create a health checker for views
- syntax heighlighter for views?
