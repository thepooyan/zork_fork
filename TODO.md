idea:
    remove junk from sentences before proccess

to make:
- dictionary has to be in xml
- excess code when wanting to add an action
- get hidden note
- sample object
- inventory query
- directions query
- healthbar
- health query
- npc creation ?!?!
- npc interactions
- involantary actions (like death, time bomb, npc talking to you)
- accidents (an action happening when you enter a view), (once or every time)
- hello action! (for fun :) )
- save/load action!
- change terminal colors
- handle unrecognized statements
- handle multiple word actions
- action to show discovered actions so far!
