idea:
    remove junk from sentences before proccess

to make:
- MinimumExpectedArgs -> fix search action
- shout action
- key and lock objects
- search action to open hidden note, with a keyword
- play balder's gate
- burn the letter
- flip the table
- better way to make views. (remove direction by hand, writing syntax?!)
- idol says diffrent random things!
- adding the veiws to the world manually is not good
- dont have to add to dictionary every action that is added
- drop or pick multiple things
- complete inventory
- cannot pick the letter
- action on inventory
- excess code when wanting to add an action
- get hidden note
- inventory and health bar
- inventory query
- directions query
- healthbar
- health query
- npc creation ?!?!
- npc interactions
- involantary actions (like death, time bomb, npc talking to you)
- accidents (an action happening when you enter a view), (once or every time)
- hello action! (for fun :) )
- save/load action!
- change terminal colors
- action to show discovered actions so far!

for later:
- handle multiple word actions
- create a health checker for views
