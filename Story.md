BLISS OF AMNISIA:
```
when you reach a good amount of progress, you suddenly die and loose the progress,
and it will be explained to you that you have to start over and this was the BLISS OF AMNISIA!
if the player continues playing the game, will encounter an apple in one of the stages, where 
there was nothing before. if they eat it, it will send them into a lucid dream where they will meet 
'the prophet'. the prophet will ask them a question about a detail of their previously lost progress,
which is hard to cheat because there are dynamic datails in the game. if they do remember the detail,
the prophet will deem them worthy of the reward and they will regain all their progress, along with a key,
that opens every green line door...

this could happen to a limited number of players (3), and will be transferred to others if after
a time passed they fail to acheive the reward.
if the reward is achived, one of the oppurtunities is gone for good...
```
